# tmux-status-variables
Tmux plugin that eases the usage of scripts in tmux status line

### Usage

Simply add the plugin name to `status-left` or `status-right` and `tmux-status-variables` will do the rest.

#### Example

Add the following to your `tmux.conf`, to show the amount of free memory:
`set -g status-left "#{free_mem}"`

#### ipinfo.io

Information is acquired using [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io), and can be formatted as any combination of the fields [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) return.

To control the format, set the *@ipinfo_format* variable to your liking. The following fields are supported:

- #ip
- #hostname
- #city
- #region
- #country
- #location
- #isp
- #asn

For instance, if you want this format: "IP_ADDRESS (ISP_NAME)", run the following:
`tmux set-option -g @ipinfo_format "#ip (#isp)"`

**!** This script requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.


### Set Options

Set the following options in your `.tmux.conf`.

You can add an additional scripts dir by setting the following:

```
set -g @user_scripts_dir "/path/to/scripts/dir"
```

otherwise, only the default script directory will be used.

### Installation with [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (recommended)

Add plugin to the list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

set -g @plugin 'odedlaz/tmux-status-variables'

Hit `prefix + I` to fetch the plugin and source it.

### Manual Installation

Clone the repo:

$ git clone https://github.com/odedlaz/tmux-status-variables /a/clone/path

Add this line to the bottom of `.tmux.conf`:

run-shell /a/clone/path/tmux_status_variables.tmux

Reload TMUX environment (type this in terminal)

  $ tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf

### How does it work?

  Each `*.tmux` scripts in the `scripts directory` and `@user_scripts_dir` is loaded.
  the name of the script is the name of the variable that'll be used in the status line.

  for example, the `free_mem.tmux` script echos the amount of free memory.
  to add it to the left status, just write: `set -g status-left "#{free_mem}"`

### Plugin skeleton

  A regular plugin only needs to have execution priviledges.
  For instance, lets look at this 'hello world' plugin:

  ```bash
#!/bin/bash
  echo "hello world!"
  ```

  If 'hello world' takes a lot of time, we might want to cache the result.
  Results are cached for `status-interval` seoconds. lets look at the following plugin:

  ```bash
#!/bin/bash
  PLUGIN_DIR=$(tmux show-option -gqv "@status_variables_dir")
  source "$PLUGIN_DIR/utils/sdk.sh"

  on_cache_miss() {
    echo "hello world!"
      sleep 1
  }

echo "$(get_cached_value on_cache_miss)"
```

Now, `on_cache_miss` will run only when `status-interval` seconds have passed.
Every call in between will return the cached result!

This is important because tmux might refreshe the status line when redrawing the pane.
Every time you press <Enter> or create a new pane, the status line is refreshed which causes many script calls.
